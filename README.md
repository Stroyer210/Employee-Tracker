## Description  :bookmark_tabs:

## Installation :computer:

You are able to check this app by two ways:

 1. If you want to check my app, you can go to this URL: 
 2. If you want to try it yourself, you have to have "Node.js" installed in your computer, then you have to clone my repository and run it locally.

## Usage :bar_chart:

If you want to try the app yourself make sure you have "Node.js" in your computer, and do not forget to run the next lines of code before opening the app:
    
    npm i
