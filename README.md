## Description  :bookmark_tabs:
Employee Tracker project was particularly rewarding; as soon as I realized what this project was I got really excited because because it addresses a real-world need that many companies face. Despite its simplicity, the application has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of employee management processes. Moreover, I enjoyed the process of developing and styling the CLI interface, adding a creative touch to the project, such a bigger title, colors, emojis. 
Employee Tracker is a command-line application built using MySQL and Inquirer. It serves as a simple yet efficient tool for managing employee data within a company. With features such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting employee records/data, as well as managing departments and roles, the application streamlines the process of employee management. I learned a lot of things throughout this project, some of those are having experience in setting up and managing a MySQL database, creating tables, defining relationships between them, error handling, styling the command-line interface (CLI) and way more. Overall, I am proud of the practical utility and user-friendly design of my application.
## Installation :computer:

You are able to check this app by two ways:

 1. If you want to check a video of the functionality of the app, you can go to this URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IkUFSgyw0KmJJ_YRdgSe5gWlImhIEvTu/view 
 2. If you want to try it yourself, you have to have "Node.js" installed in your computer, then you have to clone my repository and run it locally.

## Usage :bar_chart:

If you want to try the app yourself make sure you have "Node.js" in your computer, and do not forget to run the next lines of code to start the app:
